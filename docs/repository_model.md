# Mappings for Digital Repository JSON Objects

The repository JSON export is defined in `backend/model`. [repository_model.rb](backend/model/repository_model.rb) defines the metadata conversion from the ArchivesSpace data model to the MODS data model, and [repository_exporter.rb](backend/model/repository_exporter.rb) serializes the resulting object as MODS XML.

## Title

The name given to the resource by its creator or a curator. Title for the repository object is constructed using the ArchivesSpace item title and, if present, the creation date, e.g. "[Cane Head, circa 1865.](https://duarchives.coalliance.org/repositories/2/archival_objects/68813)"

**Repository:** `title`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Title

## URI

The unique, ArchivesSpace-specific identifier for the resource. Generated by ArchivesSpace based on the unique database identifier assigned to the archival object record.  

**Repository:** `uri`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: URI

## Local Identifier

A unique string describing the resource in a larger context, such as the collection or repository to which it belongs.

**Repository:** `identifiers.type='local'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Component ID

## Resource Type

The high-level form taken by the resource. Uses the [MODS Type of Resource vocabulary](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/userguide/typeofresource.html).

**Repository:** `resource_type`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Digital Object: Digital Object Type

## Language

The language in which the resource is expressed. Includes text expression and ISO639-2 code. If multiple language are present, coded as 'multiple languages' with a Language of Materials note.

Language is set up in the JSON object as an array, but because ArchivesSpace does not currently support including more than one entry in the Language field, this array will never have more than one language in it.

**Repository:** `language`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Language

## Dates

Dates associated with the lifecycle of the resource. Specific date types are dictated by the label assigned to them in ArchivesSpace. Dates include both human-readable expressions (e.g. "between 1915-1920") and machine-readable begin/end dates used for faceted date searching and browsing.

**Repository:** `dates`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Dates

Specific date types in use in the repository are documented below.

### Date Created

The date on which the resource was originally created. If digitized, this date refers to the analog version; if born-digital, this date refers to the original digital version.

**Repository:** `date.label = 'creation'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Dates (with "Creation" label)

### Date Digitized

The date on which the resource was digitized, if originally realized in analog format.

**Repository:** `date.label = 'digitization'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Dates (with "Digitization" label)

### Date Issued

The date on which the resource was published or otherwise made available publicly, if later than or different from the creation date.

**Repository:** `date.label = 'issued'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Dates (with "Issued" label)

## Extent

The quantitative measurement of the scope of the resource. May be measured as items, linear feet, or as electronic storage space (gigabytes).

Extents in the repository are constructed from the metadata provided in ArchivesSpace. The `extents` object is an array of strings of the form "[number] [extent_type] ([portion])".

**Repository:** `extents`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Extent

## Subjects

A coordinated heading indicating the topical, geographic, or temporal coverage of the resource, or the form or genre taken by the resource.

Subject headings in MODS are subdivided according to the term types provided when a heading is established in ArchivesSpace. These may be topical, geographic, temporal, uniform title (i.e. the title of a work, [BIBFRAME](http://bibfra.me/vocab/lite/Work) or otherwise), or genre/form headings. A heading may have more than one coordinated term.

**Repository:** `subjects`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Subjects

Additional subject properties are listed below. These are taken from the ArchivesSpace Subject data model.

### Title

The display label for the subject heading.

**Repository:** `subject.title`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Subject: Terms (coordinated)

### Terms

The constituent terms of the subject heading. This is structured as an array, ordered by the coordinated term order of the ArchivesSpace subject heading; term types are included.

**Repository:** `subject.terms`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Subject: Terms

### Source

The source of the subject heading. Options include:

* LCSH
* Local (if the term does not exist in any of the above vocabularies)
* Provisional (if it may be in one of the above vocabularies but has not been confirmed by a Digital Collections Technician)

**Repository:** `subject.source`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Subject: Source

### Authority ID

The URI for the subject heading, if drawn from a controlled vocabulary (indicated in the Source). Not needed if the subject heading is local.

**Repository:** `subject.authority_id`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Subject: Authority ID

## Notes

Descriptive statements about the resource and its context. In the repository object, `notes` is an array of hashes containing specific note types (identified by their `label` property), and a `content` property containing the note text.

Specific instructions and definitions of archival note types may be found below. Not all possible note types may be documented.

**Repository:** `notes`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Notes

### Abstract

A concise summary of the key points of a larger work, often used to assist the reader in determining if that work is likely to be of use.

**Repository:** `note.label = 'abstract'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Note (with "abstract" type)

### Biographical/Historical

The biographical/historical note places the resource in context by providing basic information about its creator or author.

**Repository:** `note.label = 'bioghist'`  
**ArchivesSpace:** Archival Object: Note (with "bioghist" type)
